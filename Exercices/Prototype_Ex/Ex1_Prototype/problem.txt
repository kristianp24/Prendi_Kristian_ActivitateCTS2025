A car rental company maintains a large fleet of cars.
Whenever a customer rents a car, the system needs to generate a new rental agreement with all car details
(model, insurance, rental period). Instead of manually inputting all details,
the company wants to clone an existing car rental agreement template and modify
only the customerâ€™s information. There are 2 types of agreements: short-term( <6 months) and long-term.
