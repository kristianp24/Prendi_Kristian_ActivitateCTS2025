A task manager is required for an operating system.
The system should maintain a single instance that keeps track of all running processes.
 Each process has attributes like PID, name, and memory usage.
 The manager should allow adding new processes, removing processes,
 and retrieving the list of running processes. Implement this using a singleton collection.
